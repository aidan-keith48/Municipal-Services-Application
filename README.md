## Features

### Core Features:

- **Service Request Management:**  
  - The core functionality of the application is managing and tracking service requests submitted by users.  
  - Users can view all requests in an organized DataGrid, where each request includes essential details such as request ID, title, status, priority, date submitted, and progress.  
  - The application utilizes advanced data structures like Binary Search Trees for efficient search operations, Max Heaps for prioritizing tasks, and Graphs for managing dependencies between service requests.  
  - Users can create new requests with detailed fields like title, status, priority, and dependencies, ensuring each request is accurately categorized and prioritized.  
  - Deletion functionality allows users to remove completed or invalid requests, keeping the system up-to-date.  
  - All new or updated requests are seamlessly integrated into the underlying data structures, ensuring real-time updates in both UI and internal processing.  
  - The "Prioritized Requests" tab dynamically displays high-priority tasks for easy accessibility, while the "Request Dependencies" tab visually maps the relationships between tasks.  

- **Report Issues:**  
  - Users can report various municipal issues such as sanitation, road damage, utility failures, and more.  
  - The system allows users to specify details like location, category, and description, ensuring accurate and clear reports.

## Data Structures in Detail

The application leverages advanced data structures to efficiently manage service requests, prioritize tasks, and handle dependencies. Below is an in-depth look at each data structure, its role in the application, and how it is implemented and integrated.

---

### 1. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**

#### **Role**:
- The Binary Search Tree (BST) is used to store and retrieve service requests based on their unique `RequestId`.
- It optimizes search operations, making the "Search BST" functionality efficient.

#### **Implementation**:
- The `BinarySearchTree` class is initialized during the repository setup in the `InitializeBST` method.
- All existing service requests are inserted into the BST when initialized.
- When a new service request is added, it is also inserted into the BST (`_bst.Insert(request)`).

#### **Integration**:
- **Repository Integration**:
  - The BST is updated during the `AddServiceRequest` method, ensuring the new request is searchable immediately.
  - The `SearchInBST(int requestId)` method in the repository performs a direct search in the BST.
- **ViewModel Integration**:
  - The `SearchUsingBST` command in the `ServiceRequestStatusViewModel` uses the repositoryâ€™s `SearchInBST` method.
  - Example:
    ```csharp
    var result = _repository.SearchInBST(requestId);
    if (result != null)
    {
        ServiceRequests.Clear();
        ServiceRequests.Add(result);
    }
    ```

#### **Advantages**:
- **Search Efficiency**: The time complexity for search operations is \(O(\log n)\) in a balanced BST.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Any new, updated, or deleted requests are immediately reflected in the BST.

#### **Example**:
When a user searches for a request with ID `17`, the application queries the BST, quickly locating the request without iterating over the entire list.

---

### 2. **Max Heap**

#### **Role**:
- The Max Heap ensures that the service request with the highest priority is always at the root.
- It is used in the "Prioritized Requests" tab to display requests in descending order of priority.

#### **Implementation**:
- The `MaxHeap` class is initialized during the repository setup in the `InitializeHeap` method.
- All existing service requests are added to the heap during initialization.
- New requests are inserted into the heap using `_maxHeap.Insert(request)`.

#### **Integration**:
- **Repository Integration**:
  - The heap is updated dynamically during the `AddServiceRequest` method.
  - Prioritized requests are extracted from the heap using the `GetPrioritizedRequests` method, which clears and refills the heap to maintain its structure.
- **ViewModel Integration**:
  - The `LoadPrioritizedRequests` command in the `ServiceRequestStatusViewModel` fetches prioritized requests from the repository.
  - Example:
    ```csharp
    foreach (var request in _repository.GetPrioritizedRequests())
    {
        PrioritizedRequests.Add(request);
    }
    ```

#### **Advantages**:
- **Dynamic Prioritization**: Automatically adjusts the highest-priority request as new tasks are added or removed.
- **Efficient Retrieval**: The highest-priority request can be accessed in \(O(1)\) time.

#### **Example**:
If a new request with priority `100` is added, it will automatically appear at the top of the "Prioritized Requests" tab.

---

### 3. **Graph**

#### **Role**:
- The Graph represents dependencies between service requests.
- Each node corresponds to a service request, and edges represent dependencies between them.

#### **Implementation**:
- The `Graph` class is initialized during the repository setup in the `InitializeGraph` method.
- Dependencies are added using the `_graph.AddEdge(request.RequestId, dependency)` method.
- The graph supports operations like dependency retrieval (`GetDependencies`) and topological sorting (`TopologicalSort`).

#### **Integration**:
- **Repository Integration**:
  - Dependencies are added to the graph during the `AddServiceRequest` method.
  - The `GetDependencies(int requestId)` method retrieves dependencies for a specific request.
- **ViewModel Integration**:
  - The `LoadDependencies` command in the `ServiceRequestStatusViewModel` fetches dependencies for a selected request.
  - Example:
    ```csharp
    foreach (var dep in dependencies)
    {
        var request = _repository.GetRequestById(dep);
        if (request != null)
        {
            DependencyRequests.Add(request);
        }
    }
    ```

#### **Advantages**:
- **Dependency Management**: Helps in visualizing and managing tasks that depend on each other.
- **Topological Sorting**: Ensures requests are processed in the correct order, respecting dependencies.

#### **Example**:
If "Water Supply Issue" depends on "Sewer Backup," this relationship is represented as an edge in the graph and visualized in the "Request Dependencies" tab.

---

### 4. **Priority Queue**

#### **Role**:
- A priority queue (backed by the Max Heap) handles tasks and events requiring priority-based management.

#### **Implementation**:
- The priority queue leverages the Max Heap, ensuring efficient insertion and retrieval of high-priority items.

#### **Integration**:
- The priority queue is indirectly used in the "Prioritized Requests" tab through the Max Heap.
- Recommendations and event prioritization also leverage this data structure.

#### **Advantages**:
- **Efficiency**: Ensures the highest-priority tasks/events are displayed first.
- **Scalability**: Can handle dynamic additions and updates without degrading performance.

#### **Example**:
In the "Prioritized Requests" tab, the queue ensures that tasks like "Flood Control" appear higher due to their critical nature.

---

### 5. **Dictionaries**

#### **Role**:
- Dictionaries are used to store and quickly retrieve service requests, events, and announcements based on unique keys.

#### **Integration**:
- **Repository Integration**:
  - The `GetRequestById(int requestId)` method retrieves a request using LINQ but could be optimized using a dictionary.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Fast Lookups**: Average time complexity of \(O(1)\) for retrieval operations.
  - **Ease of Use**: Simplifies data storage and retrieval.

---

## Integration Summary

The repository acts as a bridge, integrating these data structures to manage service requests effectively:

1. **Adding a Request**:
   - The request is added to the in-memory list (`_serviceRequests`).
   - It is also inserted into the BST and Max Heap for efficient searching and prioritization.
   - Dependencies are added to the graph.

2. **Searching for a Request**:
   - The ViewModel invokes the repository's `SearchInBST` or `SearchRequests` methods.
   - The repository queries the BST or performs a linear search based on the use case.

3. **Prioritizing Requests**:
   - Requests are managed dynamically in the Max Heap.
   - The "Prioritized Requests" tab retrieves and displays these in order of importance.

4. **Visualizing Dependencies**:
   - The graph ensures that dependencies are clearly mapped.
   - The TreeView in the "Request Dependencies" tab displays these relationships hierarchically.

This seamless integration between the repository, ViewModel, and advanced data structures ensures a robust and user-friendly application.
